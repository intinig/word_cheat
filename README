WORD CHEAT
by Giovanni Intini <giovanni@mikamai.com>

This is a simple anagrams tool that someone could use to cheat at word games, like Word Challenge on Facebook ]:)

Usage is quite simple, drop a wordlist in resources/ and customize cheat.rb to load that word list. Calling cheat.rb with the original word as an argument (i.e. $ cheat.rb wordtoanagram) will ouput to STDOUT a list of the words that are anagrams of the original word or of a subset of its letters.

Test coverage is at 100% and the solution is quite clever (IMHO :)), feel free to contribute or do whatever you wish with it.
